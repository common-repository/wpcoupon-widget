thanks for your feedback 

Installation:
Though technically a plugin, WPcoupon widget  is a theme when it’s activated on your WordPress website. We chose to have WPcoupon widget as a plugin because it offers us (and you!) far more flexibility in terms of options and features

Before you begin make sure you have a current backup of your WordPress installation and your database. It’s highly unlikely anything will go wrong, but you can always be sure that it won’t matter by backing up… right?

You should also make sure that your WordPress/MU installation is up to date, and that you’re not having any other issues prior to installing/upgrading WPcouponwidget. This will help you identify and solve any issues post-install.
